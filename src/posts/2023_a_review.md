In my third year at university, I started to see my life more clearly. I closed off my internship at a tech company and decided to pursue a tech career, or at least consider it. That decision led me to build an application for my final project. I had fun building said application.

I made a plan for the next few years — a high-level plan.

1.  Graduate
2.  Complete my service in the NYSC
3.  Get a Masters degree in Canada
4.  Become a permanent resident in Canada
5.  Profit?!?

In my final year, Covenant University held a career fair. My friend Emmanuel and I talked with a consultant from BCG, and my plans changed. The allure of consultancy — the variety of work, the travel, the $$$ — pulled me in. I would pursue a career as a consultant.

I attended Edubridge Academy. I spent months learning and practicing case studies. I didn’t get into BCG. Or McKinsey. Through NYSC (I was a member of the OBS), I got posted to Fritova, a consulting firm near OPIC, Lagos. I thought that would be a good starting point, but the transport cost, distance, and traffic meant I couldn’t go through with it. I asked to be rejected.

So, I started 2023 working at MMIA in the commercial department. I hated it. Log this, Log that. Move this file. Print this. Talk to that person. I despised it. The monotony wrapped me in a straitjacket. I was losing my mind. One day, I saw an ad for a back-end developer at a fintech called ErrandPay.

I applied. I interviewed. I got the role.

At ErrandPay, I had a good time. I enjoyed my work and learned a lot. I met lovely people who have influenced me in ways they will never know.

Nine months later, I’m no longer at ErrandPay for many reasons. However, I see my life more clearly now. I know what I want to do and the career I wish to pursue.

Between January and now, I have:

- grown out and twisted/braided/plaited my hair  
  — It’s not a big deal to anyone who isn’t me or my dad. He insists that this is the first step on a path of waywardness. I’m just tired of having to comb my hair all the time
- completed NYSC  
  — My service year was less stressful than most. I ran from the Editorial team to join Sports and had a lot of fun there. It was nice having a four-day workweek
- had my phone stolen  
  — Sigh.
- bought a new phone  
  — A waste of money because of the next point
- had that new phone destroyed by dropping it in a toilet  
  — Sighhhhhh.
- fixed an older phone  
  — I realized I could have fixed the old phone instead of spending 100k on a new phone. You live, you learn, right?
- received countless rejections  
  — The tech industry is brutal, and the competition is **fierce**. Since I started a bit late, I have to cover more ground in less time to match up
- dealt with loneliness-fueled depression  
  — My friends keep moving out of the estate, and some leave the country entirely. When March comes around, I should be the only one left here
- battled imposter syndrome
- built some cool projects that won’t see daylight
- learned a TON
- met some lovely people
- Healed and got over her.

In some ways, I’m not the same person I was in January. In other ways, I still am.

There’s still a lot of uncertainty, like which school I will attend in Canada. Or what will I do between now and when I receive admission? Do I get a job when I won’t even spend a year with them? Sigh.

My plan had many, many gaps. But that’s understandable; I was just a kid. Now, I’m a slightly older kid. So, I’ll make a new plan. I’ll fill in the gaps and outline the future.

Perhaps by this time next year, I’ll see my life and future differently. Maybe that’s part of growing up.
