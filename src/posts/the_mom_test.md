I'm reading a chapter of this everyday. I'll note my main takeaways in this post. Note, when there's a piece of dialogue, `C` is the customer and `M` is me - the idea guy.

## Chapter 1: The Mom Test

Once you avoid mentioning your idea, you start to ask better questions. Mentioning that it is **your** idea biases the people you're conversing with and leads to dishonest, unhelpful answers. So, avoid doing so for as long as possible.

Here are 3 simple rules:

- Talk about their life and problems, not yours. People love to yap about themselves.
- Ask for specifics in the past, not about some uncertain future. People tend to be overly optimistic & generic about the future.
- Listen more. Talk less.

## Chapter 2: Avoiding Bad Data

There are three forms of bad data:

- Compliments
- Fluff (generic, hypothetical & the future)
- Ideas

### Deflect Compliments

Unless the opinion comes from an industry expert, it's useless. Only facts and commitments are worth the effort. Avoid compliments by not talking about your idea.  

If you do get a compliment, deflect it and return to the crux of the conversation. Deflecting involves redirecting the conversation to have the customer talk more about themselves and their problems.

**An Example**

C: Great idea, I think it'll work out.  
M: Speaking of that problem, how do you guys work around it here?  

Always try to answer these questions:

- Why did that person like the idea?
- How much money would it save him? How would it fit into his life?
- What else has he tried which failed to solve his problem?

### Anchor Fluff

Fluff comes in generic (I usually or I always), future (I will or I would), and hypothetical (I might, I could) flavours. In case of fluff: Ask when it last happened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it, and what else they tried.  

Never ask _"Would you pay for X?"_. The answer is **always** fluff.

Fluff-inducing questions include:

- “Do you ever…”
- “Would you ever…”
- “What do you usually…”
- “Do you think you…”
- “Might you…”
- “Could you see yourself…”

They can be used to lead into a mom-test conversation though. Like asking, _"Have you ever had this problem?"_, then continuing with the _in case of fluff_ questions.

You can also drill down into a fluff statement to get a concrete example:

C: "I always have this issue!"  
M: "Really? When last did it happen?"  

**Important**: If someone has never tried searching for a solution to a problem, they are a complainer - not a customer.

### Dig Beneath Ideas

Entrepreneurs get a lot of ideas, but as one, you should not write every idea you get into the to-do list. When someone gives a feature request, figure out the motivation for the request.

- What are they trying to achieve?
- How would the feature help them get there?
- How important is it?
- Why do they bother doing it this way?
- Why do they want the feature?
- How are they currently coping without the feature?

This helps avoid feature creep, and in some cases, you can figure out an easier way to solve the problem hidden behind the request.Similarly, if someone gives off a strong emotional signal about a topic - dive into it.

For example, if the person you're talking to seems frustrated about something, ask:

- "That seems to really annoy you. What's up?"

Or if they seem excited about something, ask:

- "You seem excited heh, why? Is it a big deal?"

### Stop Seeking Approval

The main cause of compliments is seeking approval. Keep the conversation focused on the other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. Never bring up your idea, ego, business or circumstances ELSE people will try not to hurt your feelings!

### Cut Off Pitches

If you find yourself in pitch mode, cut it off and return to talking about the customers situation. It happens because you're excited about the idea, but don't let it kill you.

If they say they really want to hear about what you’re working on, promise that you’ll tell them at the end of the meeting or loop them in for an early demo, and that you just want to talk a bit more about their stuff before biasing them with your idea.

### Talk Less

Even if someone misunderstands what you're talking about, allow them finish _before_ correcting them. Hearing their POV/mental model can give a new view of the situation that you may not have found yourself. Also, no one likes being interrupted. In a nutshell, the less you talk, the better.
