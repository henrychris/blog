I'm reading a chapter of this everyday. I'll note my main takeaways in this post. Note, when there's a piece of dialogue, `C` is the customer and `M` is me - the idea guy.

## Chapter 1: The Mom Test

Once you avoid mentioning your idea, you start to ask better questions. Mentioning that it is **your** idea biases the people you're conversing with and leads to dishonest, unhelpful answers. So, avoid doing so for as long as possible.

Here are 3 simple rules:

- Talk about their life and problems, not yours. People love to yap about themselves.
- Ask for specifics in the past, not about some uncertain future. People tend to be overly optimistic & generic about the future.
- Listen more. Talk less.

## Chapter 2: Avoiding Bad Data

There are three forms of bad data:

- Compliments
- Fluff (generic, hypothetical & the future)
- Ideas

### Deflect Compliments

Unless the opinion comes from an industry expert, it's useless. Only facts and commitments are worth the effort. Avoid compliments by not talking about your idea.

If you do get a compliment, deflect it and return to the crux of the conversation. Deflecting involves redirecting the conversation to have the customer talk more about themselves and their problems.

**An Example**

C: Great idea, I think it'll work out.  
M: Speaking of that problem, how do you guys work around it here?

Always try to answer these questions:

- Why did that person like the idea?
- How much money would it save him? How would it fit into his life?
- What else has he tried which failed to solve his problem?

### Anchor Fluff

Fluff comes in generic (I usually or I always), future (I will or I would), and hypothetical (I might, I could) flavours. In case of fluff: Ask when it last happened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it, and what else they tried. 

Never ask _"Would you pay for X?"_. The answer is **always** fluff.

Fluff-inducing questions include:

- “Do you ever…”
- “Would you ever…”
- “What do you usually…”
- “Do you think you…”
- “Might you…”
- “Could you see yourself…”

They can be used to lead into a mom-test conversation though. Like asking, _"Have you ever had this problem?"_, then continuing with the _in case of fluff_ questions.

You can also drill down into a fluff statement to get a concrete example:

C: "I always have this issue!"  
M: "Really? When last did it happen?"

**Important**: If someone has never tried searching for a solution to a problem, they are a complainer - not a customer.

### Dig Beneath Ideas

Entrepreneurs get a lot of ideas, but as one, you should not write every idea you get into the to-do list. When someone gives a feature request, figure out the motivation for the request.

- What are they trying to achieve?
- How would the feature help them get there?
- How important is it?
- Why do they bother doing it this way?
- Why do they want the feature?
- How are they currently coping without the feature?

This helps avoid feature creep, and in some cases, you can figure out an easier way to solve the problem hidden behind the request.Similarly, if someone gives off a strong emotional signal about a topic - dive into it.

For example, if the person you're talking to seems frustrated about something, ask:

- "That seems to really annoy you. What's up?"

Or if they seem excited about something, ask:

- "You seem excited heh, why? Is it a big deal?"

### Stop Seeking Approval

The main cause of compliments is seeking approval. Keep the conversation focused on the other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. Never bring up your idea, ego, business or circumstances ELSE people will try not to hurt your feelings!

### Cut Off Pitches

If you find yourself in pitch mode, cut it off and return to talking about the customers situation. It happens because you're excited about the idea, but don't let it kill you.

If they say they really want to hear about what you’re working on, promise that you’ll tell them at the end of the meeting or loop them in for an early demo, and that you just want to talk a bit more about their stuff before biasing them with your idea.

### Talk Less

Even if someone misunderstands what you're talking about, allow them finish _before_ correcting them. Hearing their POV/mental model can give a new view of the situation that you may not have found yourself. Also, no one likes being interrupted. In a nutshell, the less you talk, the better.

## Chapter 3: Asking Important Questions

While it is important to ask non-biasing questions, it's even more important for you to not over compensate and ask trivial or useless questions.

One way to prevent this, is to ask the hard, important questions. These are questions whose answers affect the existence of your startup.

The best way to find these questions is to run thought experiments. Imagine that the company has failed and ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical pieces.

_Rule of thumb: You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you’re asking in every conversation._

### Love Bad News

Although bad news is upsetting, it can save you a lot of time and money. It's better to go out, talk to customers, find out they don't care about your idea, and close up shop without having spent a dime.

Lukewarm answers = disinterest. If you receive a lukewarm answer you can try to understand the nature of their apathy, but don't try to pitch them until they join you, it never works.

Remember, customers never know if a product will succeed - only the market knows.

_Rule of thumb: There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!” You can’t build a business on a lukewarm response._

### Look Before You Zoom

Like mentioned in one of the earlier chapters, a person isn't a customer if they haven't tried solving a problem they claim to have.

If you aren't sure whether the problem you're solving is a must-solve, it helps to be more generic when starting a conversation, so you can figure out if the person you're talking to has problems you are looking to solve.
If they do have the problem, you can zoom in and figure out if they are willing to put their money where their mouth is.

If you are sure the problem you're solving is a must-solve, you can immediately zoom in on it in a conversation. For example, if you're solving marketing for small businesses, you can start with _"So what are your problems with marketing?"_.

### How do you know if this problem matters?

Try these or variations of these:

- “How seriously do you take your business?” 
- “Do you make money from it?”
- “Have you tried making more money from it?”
- “How much time do you spend on it each week?”
- “Do you have any major aspirations for your businese?”
- “Which tools and services do you use for it?”
- “What are you already doing to improve this?”
- “What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?”

_Rule of thumb: Start broad and don't zoom in until you’ve found a strong signal, both with your whole business and with every conversation. And remember, if the person hasn't tried solving this problem, they are not a customer but a complainer._

### Look At The Elephant

Asking the big questions is scary. It's easy to avoid them to find some comfort. Startups have multiple failure points and it's important to focus on every single one, not ignore the elephant in the room and hope it goes away.

There are two main kinds of risk to consider:

- **Product risk** — Can I build it? Can I grow it? Will they keep using it?
- **Market risk** — Do they want it? Will they pay? Are there enough of them?

There are failure points to consider within each bucket. Both must be considered.

However in some cases - like if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed to pure market risk) - you’re not going to be able to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting point, but you’ll have to start building product earlier and with less certainty than if you had pure market risk.

### Prepare Your List of 3

Always have a list of the 3 important questions you need to ask for your business at any given time.

Planning these ahead of time makes it easier to pass the Mom test in a conversation.

Curate the questions to the different types of segments of customers you have. Always have them in mind so you can casually pop one off instead of asking the customer to grab a coffee.

Keep it casual.

## Chapter 4 - Keeping It Casual

In his original book, _4 Steps to the Epiphany_, Steve Blank recommends scheduling 3 separate meetings: the first about the customer and their problem; the second about your solution; and the third to sell a product. By splitting the meetings, you avoid zooming in on a 'problem' too early and biasing the customer by mentioning your idea.

There are problems with this approach though.

- it takes a lot of time. You gotta schedule the meeting, find a free calendar block, commute to the meeting, do introductions, finally talk about what you came to talk about. In doing so, you risk the chance of biasing the customer because you have to tell them why you want to talk to them in the first place.
- At the start, founders are often not credible enough for customers to commit to meeting with them.

It's difficult and expensive to go with this approach. Expensive because a founder's most valuable resource is time.

The solution to this? Keeping it casual.

The first meeting doesn't need to be scheduled. You can start a casual conversation with a potential customer, slide in one of your big 3 questions, and get out before they realise you've had them validate your idea.

You can return to schedule a meeting when you have something concrete to show & need to close a sale.

_Rule of thumb: Learning about a customer and their problems works better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting._

### The Meeting Antipattern

Asking the right questions is fast and touches on topics people find quite interesting. You can talk anywhere and save yourself the formal meetings until you have something concrete to show.

Setting up a meeting sets an expectation that you have something to sell them. A casual conversation is good for both parties because you've given them a chance to talk about themselves and their problems - who doesn't like talking about themselves?

_Rule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking to you, it’s probably too formal._

### How long are meetings?

As you go from product validation -> finding existing solutions -> understanding their workflow -> closing a sale, the meetings take longer.

Early chats are quick, later chats require more talking to cover the ins and outs of each situation.

_Note: You'll make progress a lot faster if you’re able to leave your idea out of it for as long as possible._

### Putting It Together

Even within a scheduled meeting, you'd do well to keep it casual and non-biasing for maximum value.

While making small talk, you can slide in a big 3 question and get an answer, while the customer has no clue you're planning to sell something to them later on.

Just make sure you have an answer for when they ask you "So what did you wanna talk about?"

_Rule of thumb: Give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the discussion in a useful direction._

## Chapter 5 - Commitment and Advancement

In sales, moving a sales relationship to the next stage is called "advancement". At this point, they make it clear whether they are a customer or not. After the previous chapters, we should know enough about the industry and it's problems to start showing our product and asking customers for some form of commitment.

- **Commitment** — They are showing they’re serious by giving up something they value such as time, reputation, or money. 
- **Advancement** — They are moving to the next step of your real-world funnel and getting closer to a sale.

_Rule of thumb: "Customers" who keep being friendly but aren’t ever going to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals. Don't friend zone your startup._

### All Meetings Succeed or Fail

There's no such thing as a meeting going well. Either it succeeded, and the customer made some sort of commitment. Or they are being wishy washy, and are never going to commit or you never asked in the first place to give them the chance to reject you.

To avoid wasting time with meetings you must:

- Not go in asking their opinion about your product (compliment seeking)
- Ask for a clear commitment or next steps

It goes without saying that you must know what your next steps are before you're able to ask. It's best if you ask and are rejected, than to never ask and waste time.

If people are willing to commit, it's a strong sign that they are telling the truth.

_Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless._

### The currencies of conversation

Commitment doesn't need to be cash, it could fall into one of these buckets:

**Reputation**

- Intro to peers or team
- Intro to a decision maker (boss, spouse, lawyer)
- Giving a public testimonial or case study

**Time**

- Clear next meeting with known goals
- Sitting down to give feedback on wireframes
- Using a trial themselves for a non-trivial period

**Cash**

- Letter of intent (non-legal but gentlemanly agreement to purchase)
- Pre-order
- Deposit

Of course, all these categories can be combined at once. The real world is flexible!

_Rule of Thumb: The more they give up, the more seriously you can take their words. But if they're handing out compliments, you can take it as a sign that they want you gone._

### Some Examples For Handling Non-Commitment

- **Stalling**: ask for an early commitment, or ask why it can't be done _today_
- **Compliments**: Deflect, get back to business
- **Promises to introduce you to people when you're ready**: find out who they are, and why it can't be done ASAP, and what the hell ready means.
- **What are the next steps**: Great result. You better have the next steps on hand.
- **"I would definitely buy that"**: Generic fluff, ask for a financial commitment.
- **"When can we start the trial"**: Depends. some products are easy to try. You can gauge how committed they are by increasing the cost: asking for a case study, asking them to use it with more of their teammates, and so on.
- **"Can I buy the prototype?"**: Excellent outcome!
- **"When can you come meet the rest of the team?"**: Excellent outcome!

### How To Fix a Bad Meeting

Ask for some commitment. Don't try to strongarm them, just ask for some form of commitment and give them the chance to directly reject you.

_Rule of thumb: It’s not a real lead until you’ve given them a concrete chance to reject you._

### Don't Pitch Blind

At this point, you know enough about the industry, surely. But this doesn't mean you go around applying the same template to everyone. Find out what makes each customer tick, and you're more likely to close with them.

### Crazy Customers

You want to find the crazy customers. These people or companies:

- Have the problem
- Know they have the problem
- Have the budget to solve the problem
- Have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution

They want you to succeed and are often irrational about it.

When someone isn’t that emotional about what you’re doing, it’s pretty unlikely that they’re going to end up being one of the people who is crazy enough to be your first customer. Keep them on the list, but don’t count on them to write the first check.

Secondly, whenever you see the deep emotion, do your utmost to keep that person close. They are the rare, precious fan who will get you through the hard times and turn into your first sale.

In summary, after you've learned the facts of your industry and customers and designed the solution, you start pushing for advancement and commitments to separate dead leads from real customers.

_Rule of thumb: In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is just a side-effect._
