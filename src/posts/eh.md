Eighteen years ago,

The most pain I’d ever known

was the hospital air that bit my skin.

Fifteen years ago,

The most pain I’d ever known

was the asphalt grinding against my lip,

as I fell, running towards my dad.

Five years ago,

The most pain I’d ever known

was the girl I loved,

choosing to love me as a friend.

Currently,

The most pain I’ve ever known

is… well, it is…

The realisation that I will be

forgotten someday.
