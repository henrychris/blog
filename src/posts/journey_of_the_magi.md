My name is Melchior.

I have been a scholar for most of my life. I studied the scriptures, literature and the stars- astrology fascinated me.

A star caught my attention as I watched the skies, for it was unlike the others. It shone with a golden sheen- its appearance was somewhat glorious. I gathered my friends, Balthasar and Gaspar, scholars like myself.

We soon realised this star was unique, it had a message behind it.

_A king had been born._

We quickly packed for the journey and set off westward towards Jerusalem.

On arrival, we asked around for the birthplace of the new king. In time, King Herod summoned us to the palace.

The palace was built with white marble, the walls stood high above every other thing. Inside, water flowed from brazen statues, and vessels of silver and gold adorned the rooms. Terrific paintings and effigies of Herod adorned his throne room.

“What brings you, fine people, to Jerusalem! I heard you are searching for a newborn. A king?” Herod asked.

He listened to our story, polite as a spring breeze.

“Oh! You must go to Bethlehem then.”

“Bethlehem?” Balthasar interjected.

“It may surprise you, but I am also well versed in the scriptures,” Herod replied.

Gaspar butted in, “It is no surprise to us. Only learned men may rule.”

“The prophet, Micah, said the king would be born in Bethlehem. Do return and tell me where he is, for I will love to visit him too!”

The guards escorted us out.

Night had fallen when we got to Bethlehem. The star had come to a stop over a small house. We tied up our camels and went in.

The dimly-lit house was quiet. The single room lacked rich tapestries, servants and beautiful ornaments. A stark contrast to the palace. It was modest.

The mother lay within- child swaddled in her arms. Sat on the right, his father looked down at him with fondness.

Gaspar coughed, to announce our presence. The mother was shocked to see the visitors and held her child closer.

“Do not worry, we are not here to hurt you,” Balthasar said.

“Nor will we take much of your time,” Gaspar continued, with a gentle smile.

“We saw his birth star from the East and came to visit. We brought gifts. Gifts fit for our new king,” I stated.

I nodded to my friends, as we kneeled before mother and child.

Gaspar gave gold, Balthasar offered franckincense, and I presented a bottle of myrrh.

The mother raised her eyebrows at the last gift.

“We will leave you to rest now. Thank you for your time.”

My friends and I took leave.

I had a strange dream that night.

I stood on a grassy plain that stretched farther than the horizon, underneath a clear blue sky. The sun became pure white, bright and glorious. Angels rose in terrifying glory, wings outstretched as they surrounded the light.

A voice spoke from the sun- greater than any other to reach my ears, it warned me not to return to Herod.

I woke up, sweating profusely. Balthasar and Gaspar barged into the room.

“Did you two have the same dream as I?” I asked.

“If yours was a warning, then yes”, Gaspar responded.

I let my breath return.

Balthasar spoke, “I wondered what sort of king would be born amidst poverty.”

“The king of the Jews? The one the scriptures foretold? Prophets Isaiah and Micah- Do you not remember?” I inquired.

The silence hung in the air for a while.

“Well, we must not wait for dawn. Lest the king sends men to search for us.” Gaspar returned to his room.

As we untied our camels, Balthasar asked me, “How do you feel about this trip?”

I paused to think, then remarked with a grin; “We stood face to face with royalty, could I be more satisfied?”

Then we set off to our own land, via a different route.
