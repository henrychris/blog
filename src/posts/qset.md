In November 2024, I was considering moving out of my parent’s home. The power situation had driven me to the edge of insanity as on most days, I had less than 2 hours of electricity. This left me unable to work comfortably, but as an employee, I had no choice in the matter. My workarounds were exhausting. I would leave to work at a nearby lounge or my mom’s office 15 minutes away. Or, I would charge my laptop to 100% overnight and usea a 40,000 mAh powerbank to keep it running. I wanted out.

But before I could move, I needed an apartment that ticked all my boxes. There were many, but for this article, only one matters: I needed to find a place where I could play football nearby.

I'm a software engineer. I spend all day at a desk, staring at a screen, tapping keys for money. To stay healthy, I play football three times a week. This is crucial because I lack the discipline to exercise at home or go to a gym.

I started researching apartments and nearby football pitches. It was hard to find any. The apartments were pricey and substandard. I remember a quote of 3.5 million naira for a single-room apartment in Magodo. Its bathroom had a shower standing atop the toilet. Even at those prices, finding a nearby pitch and its session times was difficult. I decided to build a solution.

At the time, I was solely a backend engineer and the spells of frontend engineering were still a mystery. I could not build the entire application myself. I worked through my WhatsApp contacts and Twitter mutuals looking for a partner. Most were occupied with work or other projects—except Ibidapo. He said he was 'actually about to ask me the same thing.' What were the odds? We chatted, I mentioned my power struggles, and he suggested I stay at his grandma's place while we built it. So I did.

## A Month At Coker

I spent that month alternating between my job, driving to find pitches, playing ball in Gbagada, and iterating on an early version of QBall. It wasn't even called Qball then; I named it FindSportsApi. One day at Gbagada, we were waiting for our set to come in —

Before I continue, let me explain Nigerian football culture and "sets." Some pitches host what Ibidapo and I call drop-in sessions. Anyone can show up during a certain time on a certain day, e.g., every Wednesday between 4-7pm. Each person pays to access the pitch. Then, random teams—or sets—are selected from everyone present. Games usually last 10 minutes. The winner stays on until they lose. If both teams draw, they both come off for the next two teams. Let's carry on.

—we were waiting for our set to come in when the different teams started arguing about who ought to play next. This argument went on, and on, and on. The sun set, the sky went dark and the session ended without any other teams touching the pitch. We headed back and talked about how to resolve the problem. We decided to build something fast and demo it the next day.

I did not know how to build complex frontend applications then. But I did know HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I opened claude.ai, and within a few hours, we had a working prototype. We returned to Gbagada early the next day and suggested using the app to manage the teams. The day passed without arguments. I immediately realized I needed an undo/redo feature, so I added it before our next visit.

## v0

QSet v0 was a mess: one HTML file, one JS file, and one CSS file. Event listeners were strewn around. I used for-loops to inject HTML into divs. It was nonsense—but it worked. We called it 'set-tool-official' for the first few months. Eventually, I:

- rewrote the code in TypeScript and used Bun to bundle it into a single JavaScript file.
- wrapped the logic into classes for different game modules: timer, undo/redo, and the main game.
- cleaned up the UI to the best of my ability—I am a backend engineer, after all.

A lot has changed since v0. The last commit to the original QSet repository was on February 23rd, 2025. I had learned Svelte, a web framework much easier than React. After building a few toys with it, I started migrating QSet's beautiful single-file mess into a modern framework.

I built components, added toasts, and implemented a service worker for offline use. I released it on February 26. The tweet got 32k views, the application received decent traffic, and we were flooded with feature requests. We have shipped most of them, and redesigned the application too.

## Finally...

That's the origin of QSet. It was born from a personal need, hacked together in a few hours, and has been slowly improving ever since. If you're curious, you can check out the latest version at [this link](https://qset.qballxi.com). The journey from that single HTML file to what it is now has taught me more than I expected, but those are lessons for another post.

Speaking of building from personal experience, I'm already working on a new application. If all goes well, you'll see it here in a month.

Thanks for reading.
