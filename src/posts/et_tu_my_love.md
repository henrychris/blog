Rede and Joshua. They had been together from the start. They attended the same schools, all the way through university. Always together, inseparable. Some time in university, they fell for one another. Everyone had seen it coming, and they wondered why it took so long.

But, Fate is a cruel mistress. Circumstances caused them to drift apart, and drift apart they did. Months and years went by till they met again. They had both changed considerably since their uni days. He had a beard; She had… someone else. That didn’t stop the sparks from flying, though- they picked up where they had left off. Loyalty be damned.

As they spent a night together, ethics thrown to the ground with their clothes, they moved in sync like old times. Though, unlike in old times, a third party existed here.

Rede’s partner kicked down the door, brandishing a pistol. She rolled out of bed and sat up against the wall, sheets in hand covering whatever dignity she had left. Joshua went the other way and found himself staring down the barrel of a gun.

Ade’s hands could not stay still. The life he wished to take weighed heavy in his hand. Breathing hard, he cursed at Rede for her actions. He had given her everything, had he not? She sank to her feet and whimpered; the words had hit like an angry whip.

Joshua was surprisingly calm. He turned to her and said, “I told you, you would be the death of me.”

The gunshot shattered the silence of the night. Yet, Joshua still stood. In a flash, he tackled Ade and wrestled the gun off him. He stood triumphant over the hapless man. Rede grasped her phone and called the police. Joshua lit a cigar and kept the gun trained on Ade.

The police arrived; Their vehicle lights painted the room red and blue. Rede told the story: of a broken man and a room broken into. Inside, she pointed at the man she thought she loved. As the police led Joshua away, he stared into her eyes, and she looked right through him.

They were once inseparable, but as the times changed, so did they.
